# ffs — agent guide

`ffs` is a unified code search, read, and symbol-lookup tool. Output is
token-budget aware and uniformly available as either human text or JSON
(`--format json`), so agents can stay on a single CLI for the whole
read-and-reason loop.

This guide describes the public sub-commands as of the version that
shipped this file. Versions are stable; new behaviour is added as new
flags rather than via behaviour changes to existing flags.

## Global flags

* `--root <DIR>` — project root to search/index. Defaults to the
  current working directory.
* `--format text|json` — output format. `text` is the default and is
  intended for humans; `json` is canonical and intended for tools.

All sub-commands accept these.

## Pagination

Listing sub-commands (`find`, `symbol`, `callers`, `callees`, `refs`,
`flow`, `siblings`) take:

* `--limit <N>` — max items in this page (defaults differ per command;
  typically 50–100).
* `--offset <N>` — skip this many items before the page starts.
  Defaults to 0.

JSON responses always include `total`, `offset`, `has_more`. Text
responses end with a footer like `[1-50 of 217] — next: --offset 50`
that tells the next page's `--offset` directly.

## Sub-commands

### `find <needle>`
Filename matcher. Substring (case-insensitive) match against full
file paths under `--root`. Useful as the first step when you know a
filename fragment but not the full path.

### `glob <pattern>`
Shell-style glob over file paths (`**`, `*`, `?`, character classes).

### `grep <regex>`
Content search across the project. Powered by `ripgrep` semantics for
gitignore handling.

### `read <target>`
Read a file. Default emits the **agent-style outline** (header +
section list + footer hint) so agents can plan a follow-up drill
without pulling the full body. Pass `--full` for raw contents, or
use `path:line` / `--section` to drill straight into a structural
section.

Routing:
* `read <path>` — outline default (code files only; non-code files
  fall through to full body).
* `read <path>:<N>` — structural section read at line `N`.
* `read <path> --section` (combined with `path:N`) — same as above but
  errors out if the line isn't supplied, useful in scripts.
* `read <path> --full` — whole file body (legacy default).

Bare-filename auto-pick: when the literal path doesn't resolve and
`<target>` has no separator, `read` searches the workspace by file
basename (exact case first, then case-insensitive). Exactly one match
→ drills into it and surfaces the chosen path in `resolved_from`.
More than one match → emits a `mode: "candidates"` envelope listing
the top 5 paths (shortest first) so the caller can disambiguate. No
match → today's "not found" error.

* `--budget <N>` — total token budget (default 25000). Effective byte
  cap ≈ `tokens × 0.85 × 4`; the remaining ≈15% is reserved for the
  envelope and truncation footer.
* `--filter none|minimal|aggressive` — `none` keeps the file as-is;
  `minimal` strips full-line comments; `aggressive` collapses
  impl/class bodies to fit more files into the same budget.

### `outline <path>`
Tree-sitter outline of a single file: top-level functions, classes,
structs, imports, and their immediate children where applicable.

* `--style agent|tabular|markdown|structured` — text rendering.
  `agent` (default) is the dense, agent-friendly form: header line
  with file totals, `[A-B]` left column, bundled-imports row, indented
  signatures, and a `> Next:` drill hint. `tabular` is fixed-width
  columns (KIND/NAME/LINES/SIGNATURE); `markdown` is nested bullets;
  `structured` is an ASCII tree (`├─` / `└─`).
* JSON output (`--format json`) is independent of `--style` and emits
  the entry tree directly with `kind`, `name`, `start_line`,
  `end_line`, `signature`, `children`.

### `symbol <name>`
Look up a symbol definition by name. Tree-sitter AST-driven, not
substring. Trailing `*` is treated as a prefix glob: `symbol Foo*`
matches every name starting with `Foo`.

Comma-separated names emit one group per symbol: `symbol "a,b,c"`
returns a `{ query, groups: [...], total_groups }` envelope where each
group is the regular single-symbol envelope. Single-name calls are
byte-identical to before. Duplicate names are dropped (first-wins) and
whitespace around each entry is trimmed. With `--expand`, the token
budget is split across the visible hits in *all* groups (each hit gets
the same per-hit floor), so multi-symbol queries don't over-allocate.

JSON response includes a `facets` field: `{ total, by_kind }` counted
on the *full* candidate set (i.e. unaffected by `--offset` /
`--limit`). Text output appends a `by kind: function: 12, struct: 3`
line under the pagination footer.

### `callers <name>`
Find lines that reference `<name>` outside its own definition site.
Bloom-narrowed first, then confirmed with a literal-text pass.

* `--hops N` — multi-hop BFS over the caller graph (default 1, max 5).
* `--hub-guard N` — stop propagating from any single name that produces
  more than N hits in one hop (default 50). Hits still surface.
* `--count-by none|caller|file` — post-BFS frequency table. `caller`
  groups by the enclosing function/scope, `file` groups by the
  containing path. JSON gains an `aggregations: [{ key, count }]` field
  (omitted when `none`, so the default output is byte-identical); text
  output appends an `Aggregated:` section with `count  key` rows
  sorted desc, ties alphabetical.
* With `--hops > 1` the JSON payload may also expose two diagnostics
  lists, omitted when empty so single-hop output stays byte-identical:
  * `suspicious_hops: [{ depth, name, roots[] }]` — a name resolves to
    definitions in 2+ distinct package roots at the same hop (typical
    smell: trait method clash, re-exported helper).
  * `auto_hubs_promoted: [{ depth, name, count }]` — hub-guard kicked in
    for `name` at `depth` and propagation was stopped (hits still surface).
  Text output appends `Suspicious hops:` / `Auto hub-guard promotions:`
  sections only when these lists are non-empty.

### `callees <name>`
Identifiers referenced inside the body of `<name>`, then resolved
back to definitions via the symbol index. Hits with the same
`(name, path, line)` triple are de-duplicated even when they came
from multiple definition bodies of `<name>`.

* `--depth N` — walk the callee graph N hops (default 1, max 5).
  When `N > 1` each hit carries `depth` and `from` (the enclosing
  symbol whose body produced it). Default `--depth 1` keeps the
  output byte-identical to before.
* `--hub-guard N` — stop propagating from any single name that
  produces more than N hits in one hop (default 50). The hits still
  surface; only further expansion from that name is skipped.

### `refs <name>`
Definitions plus single-hop usages of `<name>` in one response.
Definitions come from the symbol index (full list, no pagination);
usages reuse the `callers --hops 1` text-confirm pass and are paged
via `--limit` / `--offset`. JSON shape:
`{ name, definitions, usages, total_usages, offset, has_more }`.
Each usage carries `enclosing` when it can be resolved via the
outline cache.

### `flow <name>`
Drill-down envelope per definition. For each definition site of
`<name>` emits one "card" containing: def metadata, header (signature
line), budget-capped body excerpt, top-N direct callees (resolved to
their defs), and top-N single-hop callers. JSON shape:
`{ name, cards: [{ def, header, body, body_start_line, body_end_line,
kept_bytes, footer_bytes, callees, total_callees, callers,
total_callers }], total_cards, offset, has_more }`. Pagination applies
to cards via `--limit` / `--offset`; sub-lists are clamped per card.

* `--callees-top N` — max callees listed per card (default 5).
* `--callers-top N` — max callers listed per card (default 5).
* `--budget N` — total body byte budget split across visible cards,
  256-byte floor per card (default 10000).
* `--no-did-you-mean` — disable fuzzy/case/prefix suggestions when
  no definitions are found (on by default).

### `siblings <name>`
Other symbols defined at the same scope as `<name>` — peer methods of
the same class, peer functions in the same file, peer items in the
same module. Top-level targets get all other top-level entries.

* `--include-imports` — off by default; on returns the file's import
  block as siblings as well.

Each hit carries `parent` (`"<file>"` for top-level, otherwise the
enclosing definition's name) and `target_path`/`target_line` so
multiple definition sites of the same name remain disambiguated.

### `map`
Workspace tree annotated with file counts and rough token estimates
per directory. Honors `.gitignore` (via `ignore::WalkBuilder`) so the
tree matches what `find` / `grep` already see.

* `--depth <N>` — render at most N directory levels (default 3); beyond
  the limit, directories collapse to a single summary line and JSON
  marks them with `truncated: true`.
* `--max-file-bytes <N>` — cap the per-file size used for the token
  estimate (default 1 MiB); raw byte counts still reflect on-disk size.
* `--bytes-per-token <N>` — chars-per-token conversion (default 4).
* `--symbols <N>` — annotate each file leaf with its top-N symbols by
  weight (tree-sitter definitions, sorted weight DESC then line ASC).
  `0` (default) keeps the output byte-identical. JSON adds a `symbols:
  [{ name, kind, line, weight }]` array under each file node and omits
  the field on directories and on files without symbols; text output
  adds indented `• name (kind, L<line>, w=<weight>)` bullets directly
  under the file's tree line.

### `impact <symbol>`
Rank workspace files by how much each one would be affected if
`<symbol>` changed. Combines three signals per file:

* `direct_callers` (single-hop call sites) — weight 3
* `reverse_imports` (imports resolving to `<symbol>`'s defn file) — weight 2
* `transitive_callers` (BFS depth 2+3 hits) — weight 1

Score = `direct*3 + imports*2 + transitive`. Output is a ranked
`results: [{ path, score, reasons[] }]` list sorted by score desc, ties
alphabetical. `reasons` only lists non-zero terms.

* `--hops <1|2|3>` — BFS depth for the transitive signal (default 3).
  `1` disables transitive entirely. Capped at 3.
* `--hub-guard <N>` — stop propagating from any single name that
  produces more than N hits in one hop (default 50). Mirrors
  `ffs callers --hub-guard`.
* `--limit N` / `--offset N` — pagination (defaults 20/0).

### `dispatch <query>`
Free-form classifier that routes a query to the right backend
(`symbol`, `symbol_glob`, `file_path`, `glob`, or content fallback).

### `index`
Build / refresh the on-disk indexes (Bigram, Bloom, Symbol, Outline)
without running a query. Useful for warming up before a session.

### `mcp`
Run as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server over stdio. Replaces
agent built-ins like Grep / Glob / Read while still exposing the same
sub-commands above.

The MCP server also exposes `engine_refs`, `engine_flow`, and `engine_impact`
tools that shell out to this CLI (`ffs refs|flow|impact ... --format
json`) under the hood. The JSON payload is the same one documented above
for each sub-command. Parameter names follow the MCP camelCase
convention: `maxResults`, `calleesTop`, `callersTop`, `hubGuard`.

### `guide`

## Lua / C bindings for engine tools

The same `refs` / `flow` / `impact` sub-commands are also reachable from
the Neovim plugin and the C FFI behind the additive `ffs` features:

* **Lua** (`require('ffs.engine')`, built with `--features engine`):
    * `engine.refs(name, limit?, offset?)`
    * `engine.flow(name, { limit, offset, callees_top, callers_top, budget })`
    * `engine.impact(name, { limit, offset, hops, hub_guard })`
  Each returns the raw JSON payload as a string (so callers can decode
  it with `vim.json.decode` on demand).

* **C ABI** (`ffs_engine_*` exports, guarded by `FFS_CODE`):
    * `ffs_engine_refs(engine, name, limit, offset)`
    * `ffs_engine_flow(engine, name, limit, offset, callees_top, callers_top, budget)`
    * `ffs_engine_impact(engine, name, limit, offset, hops, hub_guard)`
  Returns the same `FfsEngineResponse` envelope as `ffs_engine_dispatch`;
  free it with `ffs_engine_free_response`.

Implementation note: the wrappers spawn `ffs` as a subprocess via
`std::env::current_exe()`, so the loading binary must itself be the
`ffs` CLI (the MCP server runs as `ffs mcp`, the Neovim plugin loads
this crate from the ffs binary, etc.). The default builds keep the
exports off; enable with the `ffs` Cargo feature.

## Conventions and tips

* All listing commands return `total` so an agent can decide whether
  to widen, paginate, or refine the query without a second round-trip.
* `siblings` + `outline` together let an agent reconstruct the
  enclosing scope of any symbol without re-reading the file: outline
  for kind/signature, siblings for "what else is nearby".
* Prefer `--format json` for any programmatic consumer; text output
  may evolve for readability while JSON is treated as part of the
  contract.
* Use `--limit` aggressively. Most lookups want the top 5–20 hits;
  the cost of the underlying scan is independent of `--limit` but
  output marshalling is not.
